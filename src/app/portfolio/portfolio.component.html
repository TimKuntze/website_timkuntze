        <p>Hi, I'm <b>Tim</b> from Berlin! After nearly 10 years doing <b>Marketing for Amazon.de, ATOSS Software, shyftplan and others</b>, I started to learn to develop websites and apps in summer 2020. And yes, so much can be said about Corona on the
            positive side: it really made one think about what you really want to do with your career! How I learned my skills in <b>HTML, CSS, JavaScript and AngularJS</b>? I started a developer course with the Munich-based <b><a href="https://developerakademie.com/">Developer Akademie</a></b>,
            besides my full-time job as a Marketing Manager at shyftplan. And what can I say? It worked! Including a lot of ups and downs, help from my tutors, not being afraid to ask a lot of questions and plain commitment.</p>

                            Since my first job after my studies of business psychology as Marketing Manager at Amazon.de (ca. 2011), I was building small Landing Pages with the help of a basic knowledge and understanding of HTML and CSS. So before my adventure of joining the Developer
                            Akademie, I had least some small foundation.

                            As with HTML, my first experience with CSS was at my first job at Amazon.de. A bigger experience with CSS I gained in my second job at Netzathleten Media, where I was responsible for setting up and managing display and video ads on thousands of websites
                            - of course a cleanly written CSS of our partner websites played a big role here (especially in regard of being responsive for different devices). If that was not the case, I was happy to help :). But since my days at Developer
                            Akademie I learned a lot of extra tricks and knowledge, that would have helped me a lot in that job, which I just now realized.

                            With JavaScript I had no experience whatsoever, except being the end-user, before joing the Developer Akademie. To be honest with you: when I first started to (try to) programm litte apps like a primitive QuizzApp and a little devilvery service app, I
                            thought I will never learn it properly. But it is like learning a normal language. The more you try and the more you are confronted with it, there will come the time - sooner or later - where it makes "click". Of course I can't
                            say that I'm a fluent or native speaker of JavaScript, yet. But I think I came pretty far since my start and I'm eager to reach my goals to be a natural speaker ;) - have a look at my portfolio!

                            My first AngularJS project? You're looking at it, as I programmed it with Angular. Although it was not easy to go from plain JavaScript coding to Angular, because of some things that are different, I have to say that i makes programming much more effective
